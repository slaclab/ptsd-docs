## Operation  

Once installed, there is little configuration that is necessary outside of setting proper RF input levels for the board. Prior to installation, during board assembly, jumpers are installed that determine which channels are active. For more information about these jumpers, see Assembly documentation for this module.

### Input Levels

| Signal                         | Level  | Unit  | Condition                       |
|--------------------------------|--------|-------|---------------------------------|
| Input (from laser Oscillator)  |        | mVp   | Corrected for scope parameters  |

_For additional information on measuring laser output and scope parameters, see the technical note "Bandwidth Models for Oscilloscope Response with Photodiode Signals"_
