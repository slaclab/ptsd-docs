# Thermal Pad Installation

The Bergquist TGP1000VOUS thermal pad is produced either in sheet form or pre-cut. The pad comes with a taupe side and foam side backed by a fiberglass reinforcing layer. The pad is electrically isolating.

To install the pad:

1. Cut to fit (scissors or knife)
2. place pink side on heat sink side
3. remove fiberglass backing
4. install board on exposed side

**Note: Care should be taken in cutting the pad to avoid damaging the layers**

# VDD supply (+8V)

Total consumption for the board calculates to 0.868 A, however, in practice the board draws about 1.2 A with one channel in operation.
